# Analysis of Compound Extreme Events

### A novel impact-based methodology for assessing compound impacts of hydrometeorological drivers associated with natural hazards 

<!-- - Create dynamic content with [Python](docs/computations/python.qmd), [R](docs/computations/r.qmd), [Julia](docs/computations/julia.qmd), and [Observable](docs/computations/ojs.qmd). 
- Author documents as plain text markdown or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
- Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
- Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more. -->
