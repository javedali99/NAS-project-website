# Analysis of Compound Extreme Events

### A novel impact-based methodology for assessing compound impacts of hydrometeorological drivers associated with natural hazards 

<!-- - Create dynamic content with [Python](docs/computations/python.qmd), [R](docs/computations/r.qmd), [Julia](docs/computations/julia.qmd), and [Observable](docs/computations/ojs.qmd). 
- Author documents as plain text markdown or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
- Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
- Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more. -->

### Analysis of Compound Impact
We analyzed all data to better understand what drivers are involved in each hazard recorded in SHELDUS, as well as knowing how often the impacts result from a compound event.
