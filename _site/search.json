    "text": "This website was created by Javed Ali, a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Central Florida. The methodology for this research was developed in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Wahl, Dr. Alejandra Enriquez, and Dr. Md. Mamunur Rashid, and implemented in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Javed has been involved in a National Academy of Sciences funded project “The New First Line of Defense: Building Community Resilience through Residential Risk Disclosure”. This website is a part of the project’s deliverable.\nJaved is a Water Resources Engineer and Graduate Research Assistant in the Coastal Risks and Engineering Lab at University of Central Florida (UCF). His work involves multi-hazards risk assessment and analyzing compound climate/weather extreme events and their spatio-temporal interactions and socio-economic impacts using machine learning and statistical methods."
